# Bruteforce
WHAT IS BRUTEFORCE ATTACK?


It is a hacking method that uses trial and error to crack passwords,login credentials and encryption keys.
It is an excessively forceful attempts to gain access to user accounts.At here the hacker tries multiple usernames and passwords until they find the correct login credentials.


HOW I IMPLEMENTED IT:


First I created two word lists one for username and other for password.
I made the python script to refer to these lists and as a result of which it can look for various possible combinations of username and passwords and obtain the desired result
You can run this code in the terminal and can obatin the desired output!
